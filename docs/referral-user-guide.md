# Referral System User Guide

## Overview

The VineMe referral system allows you to connect friends, family, and acquaintances to the community. There are two ways to refer someone: general referrals for when no specific group fits, and group referrals for connecting someone to a particular group.

## Getting Started

### Accessing the Referral System

1. **From the Home Page:**
   - Look for the "Connect someone else in" section on your home screen
   - Tap the button to start the referral process

2. **From a Group Page:**
   - Navigate to any group you're interested in
   - Scroll to the bottom of the group details
   - Tap the "Refer a friend" button

## Referral Types

### General Referrals

Use general referrals when:
- You want to connect someone to the community but no specific group fits their needs
- You're not sure which group would be best for them
- You want clergy or group leaders to help match them to a group

**How to create a general referral:**
1. Tap "Connect someone else in" from the home page
2. When asked "Do you want to connect/refer someone else to a group?", select "No specific group fits"
3. Fill out the referral form with their information
4. Add a note explaining why you're referring them
5. Submit the form

### Group Referrals

Use group referrals when:
- You know exactly which group would be perfect for someone
- The person has expressed interest in a specific type of group
- You want to connect them directly to a particular community

**How to create a group referral:**
1. From the home page, tap "Connect someone else in"
2. When asked about referring to a group, select "Yes, I know a group that fits"
3. Follow the instructions to find the specific group
4. On the group page, tap "Refer a friend"
5. Fill out the referral form
6. Submit the form

## Filling Out the Referral Form

### Required Information

- **Email Address**: The person's email where they'll receive their account setup instructions
- **Phone Number**: Their phone number for contact purposes
- **Note**: A brief explanation of why you're referring them and any relevant context

### Optional Information

- **First Name**: If you know their first name, it helps personalize the experience
- **Last Name**: Their last name for a complete profile

### Tips for Writing Good Notes

- Explain how you know the person
- Mention their interests or what they're looking for
- Include any relevant background that would help group leaders
- Keep it concise but informative

**Good examples:**
- "My neighbor Sarah is new to the area and looking for community. She loves hiking and has two young kids."
- "College friend who just moved here for work. Very interested in Bible study and has leadership experience."
- "Family member going through a difficult time and could use prayer support and fellowship."

## What Happens After You Submit a Referral

### Immediate Actions

### Email Verification Process

The referred person will receive an email containing:
- Welcome message explaining they've been referred
- Link to verify their email and activate their account
- Instructions for completing their profile setup
- Information about next steps in joining the community

### Follow-up

- **For Group Referrals**: The specific group's leaders will be notified and can follow up directly
- **Account Setup**: The referred person can complete their profile and start exploring groups

## Best Practices

### When to Refer Someone

- **They've expressed interest** in faith community or small groups
- **They're new to the area** and looking for connections
- **They're going through life changes** and could benefit from support
- **You genuinely believe** they would benefit from and contribute to the community

### When NOT to Refer Someone

- **Without their knowledge or consent** - always let them know you're referring them
- **If they've explicitly said no** to religious or community involvement
- **Just to meet quotas** - quality referrals are better than quantity
- **If you don't know them well enough** to provide meaningful context

### Communication Tips

- **Let them know first**: Tell the person you're going to refer them before you do it
- **Explain the process**: Let them know they'll receive an email and what to expect
- **Be available**: Offer to answer questions or help them get started
- **Follow up**: Check in to see how their experience is going

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"The email address is already in use"**
- The person may already have a VineMe account
- Check with them to see if they've signed up before
- They can use the regular sign-in process instead

**"I made a mistake in the referral form"**
- Contact support to help correct the information
- The referred person can update their own information once they verify their email

**"They didn't receive the verification email"**
- Check their spam/junk folder
- Verify the email address was entered correctly
- Contact support if the email still hasn't arrived after 24 hours

**"I want to refer someone to multiple groups"**
- Create separate referrals for each group
- Mention in the note that you're making multiple referrals
- This helps group leaders coordinate their outreach

### Getting Help

If you encounter any issues or have questions:
- Contact your group leader for guidance
- Reach out to church staff for technical support
- Use the app's help/support feature for immediate assistance

## Privacy and Security

### Data Protection

- All referral information is kept secure and confidential
- Personal information is only shared with appropriate group leaders
- Referred persons control their own data once they activate their accounts

### Consent and Communication

- Only refer people who would welcome the connection
- Respect people's privacy and communication preferences
- Let people know you're referring them before you do it
