# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will implement a comprehensive styling system for the React Native/Expo app that provides a centralized theme management system, a complete component library with consistent styling, and an easy way to adjust themes that automatically propagate across the entire application. The system will ensure design consistency, maintainability, and flexibility for future theme customizations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a centralized theme system, so that I can easily manage colors, typography, spacing, and other design tokens across the entire application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the theme system is implemented THEN the system SHALL provide a central theme configuration file with colors, typography, spacing, shadows, and border radius definitions
2. WHEN a theme value is changed THEN the system SHALL automatically reflect that change across all components that use that theme value
3. WHEN accessing theme values THEN the system SHALL provide TypeScript type safety for all theme properties
4. WHEN the app initializes THEN the system SHALL load the default theme and make it available to all components

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a comprehensive component library, so that I can build consistent UI elements throughout the app without duplicating styling code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the component library THEN the system SHALL provide styled versions of common UI components (Button, Input, Card, Modal, etc.)
2. WHEN a component is used THEN the system SHALL automatically apply the current theme styling
3. WHEN components need variants THEN the system SHALL support multiple style variants (primary, secondary, outline, etc.)
4. WHEN components are rendered THEN the system SHALL ensure accessibility compliance with proper contrast ratios and touch targets

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want theme switching capabilities, so that I can easily test different visual styles and potentially support multiple themes in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing theme switching THEN the system SHALL support dynamic theme changes without app restart
2. WHEN a theme is switched THEN the system SHALL update all components immediately to reflect the new theme
3. WHEN themes are defined THEN the system SHALL support multiple theme configurations (light, dark, custom)
4. WHEN theme switching occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain component state and user interactions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an example implementation, so that I can see how to properly use the styling system and component library in practice.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the styling system is complete THEN the system SHALL include an example screen demonstrating various components
2. WHEN viewing the example screen THEN the system SHALL showcase different component variants and states
3. WHEN the example is implemented THEN the system SHALL demonstrate proper theme usage patterns
4. WHEN developers reference the example THEN the system SHALL provide clear code examples and best practices

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance-optimized styling, so that the app maintains smooth performance even with complex styling systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN styles are applied THEN the system SHALL use React Native's StyleSheet.create for optimal performance
2. WHEN themes change THEN the system SHALL minimize re-renders by using efficient state management
3. WHEN components render THEN the system SHALL avoid inline style objects that cause unnecessary re-renders
4. WHEN the app scales THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent performance regardless of the number of styled components

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integrated brand asset management, so that I can easily incorporate logos, icons, and brand elements consistently throughout the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing brand assets THEN the system SHALL provide a centralized asset management system for logos, icons, and images
2. WHEN using logos THEN the system SHALL support multiple logo variants (full, icon-only, light/dark versions) with automatic selection based on context
3. WHEN assets are updated THEN the system SHALL automatically propagate changes across all components using those assets
4. WHEN accessing brand assets THEN the system SHALL provide TypeScript-safe asset references with proper typing

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want built-in loading and animation components, so that I can provide consistent user feedback during async operations and state transitions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing loading states THEN the system SHALL provide pre-built loading components (spinners, skeletons, progress bars)
2. WHEN animations are needed THEN the system SHALL include smooth transition animations that respect user accessibility preferences
3. WHEN loading components are used THEN the system SHALL automatically adapt to the current theme colors and styling
4. WHEN performance is considered THEN the system SHALL use optimized animations that don't impact app performance

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want advanced color management, so that I can easily create color schemes, handle accessibility requirements, and support dynamic theming.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining colors THEN the system SHALL support semantic color naming (primary, success, warning) and contextual variants (light, dark, muted)
2. WHEN accessibility is required THEN the system SHALL automatically ensure WCAG contrast compliance and provide high-contrast alternatives
3. WHEN colors are used THEN the system SHALL support color opacity variations and automatic color derivations
4. WHEN themes change THEN the system SHALL smoothly transition between color schemes without jarring visual changes

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want easy integration with existing components, so that I can gradually migrate the current codebase to use the new styling system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating with existing code THEN the system SHALL be backward compatible with current component implementations
2. WHEN migrating components THEN the system SHALL provide clear migration patterns and utilities
3. WHEN both old and new systems coexist THEN the system SHALL not conflict with existing styling approaches
4. WHEN updating components THEN the system SHALL allow incremental adoption without breaking existing functionality
