## Implementation Notes

### Development Approach

- Start with database schema and core service functionality
- Build UI components incrementally with proper testing
- Integrate notification triggers one service at a time
- Add advanced features and optimizations after core functionality is stable

### Testing Strategy

- Write unit tests for each component as it's developed
- Create integration tests for complete notification flows
- Test accessibility and performance throughout development
- Validate notification delivery across different app states

### Deployment Considerations

- Database migrations should be backward compatible
- Feature flags can be used to gradually roll out notification types
- Monitor notification delivery rates and performance metrics
- Plan for gradual user adoption of new notification features

This implementation plan ensures systematic development of the enhanced notifications system while maintaining code quality and user experience standards.
