# Google Maps iOS Fix - SDK 54

## Issue
After upgrading to SDK 54, Google Maps crashes on iOS with error:
```
react-native-maps: AirGoogleMaps dir must be added to your xCode project to support GoogleMaps on iOS
```

## Root Cause
When upgrading to SDK 54, the Google Maps pods were installed but:
1. Google Maps wasn't initialized in AppDelegate
2. The native app needed to be rebuilt with the new configuration

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Added Google Maps Pods to Podfile ✅
```ruby
# Google Maps for react-native-maps
rn_maps_path = '../node_modules/react-native-maps'
pod 'react-native-google-maps', :path => rn_maps_path
pod 'GoogleMaps'
pod 'Google-Maps-iOS-Utils'
```

### 2. Initialize Google Maps in AppDelegate ✅
Added to `ios/VineMe/AppDelegate.swift`:
```swift
import GoogleMaps

// In application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:
if let apiKey = Bundle.main.object(forInfoDictionaryKey: "GMSApiKey") as? String {
  GMSServices.provideAPIKey(apiKey)
}
```

### 3. Pods Installed ✅
- GoogleMaps (8.4.0)
- Google-Maps-iOS-Utils (5.0.0)
- react-native-google-maps (1.20.1)

## Next Steps

### You Must Rebuild the iOS App

The native code has changed, so you need to rebuild:

**Option 1: Simulator (Fastest)**
```bash
npm run ios:simulator
```

**Option 2: EAS Build for Device**
```bash
eas build --profile development --platform ios
```

**Option 3: Xcode**
1. Open `ios/VineMe.xcworkspace`
2. Select target device/simulator
3. Build and Run (⌘R)

## Why This Happens

Google Maps on iOS requires:
1. ✅ Pods installed (done)
2. ✅ API key in app.config.ts (done)
3. ✅ GMSServices initialized in AppDelegate (just added)
4. ⏳ **Native app rebuilt** with above changes

Until you rebuild, the old native app (SDK 53) won't have these changes.

## Verification

After rebuilding, Google Maps will:
- ✅ Initialize properly
- ✅ Show map tiles
- ✅ Work with PROVIDER_GOOGLE
- ✅ Display markers and clusters

---

**Status:** Code changes complete - Rebuild required  
**Estimated Time:** 5-10 minutes (simulator) or 10-15 minutes (EAS)
